Hello Abdul,





README.md is missing. There should be a README.md file on the main folder which contains images, video, steps to run locally, hosted platform, details about npm packages if any, etc ( mention all the details )


Use code formatter extension and format your code ; It's not formatted properly 


Github description is missing


I did not see any footer. I think main landing page will have a footer for sure


There are a lot of warnings that are coming in when we run the project. Please clear all those warnings


Do not use inline styling. Please change that


Remove all unused logic, unused variables and unused code from project 


Folder structure is not really nice. Please fix that. Why does the Components subfolder have a pages folder as it's child. Have a separate folder for components , pages, redux etc


/signup 


Form isn't aligned in the centre . fix that. Use % or rem instead of px for uniformity. That might help to maintain consistency across screens


Why are tables being used when there better options like grid etc


/welcome


Hardcoded values are found as logic. I don't understand why

/projects


Give proper names to state and setState variables


Was moved to /time route after project creation but nothing was working. All I got was a loading spinner there


/time


There is no validation for time input


Not sure how or what start is for


/expenses

Maintain consistency in naming routes and component to avoid confusion




/invoice


PDF download implementation is nice


 Remove all the unused imports and console.log from the code before the final push. 


Either your code should be self explanatory; Since it wasn't you should make use of some comments to describe code - L . There are places it has been done and there are place it hasn't been done


Component reusability should be looked into; Also Start using components in react instead of HTML tags. Can also make use of UI libraries like material UI


Text is a bit off in navbar and is not centrally aligned


User in v=navbar and logout button


Packages imported should be at the top - leave a line - then start importing local modules ( individual files ). It's a good convention and not a compulsion though - L


UI is not responsive - work on it as well - L


Reusability can be looked into - L


Check if it's possible to have some common  CSS - L
